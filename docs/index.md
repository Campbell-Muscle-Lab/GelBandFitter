## GelBandFitter

GelBandFitter is a computer program that uses non-linear regression techniques to fit mathematical functions to densitometry profiles of protein gels. This allows for improved quantification of gels with partially overlapping and potentially asymmetric protein bands. The program was developed by Mihail Mitov, Marion Greaser (UW-Madison) and Ken Campbell and can also be used to analyze immunoblots with closely-spaced bands. 

The underlying calculations and background information can be found in [GelBandFitter -  A computer program for analysis of closely spaced electrophoretic and immunoblotted bands](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2742644/)
